# Road-Sign-Classification

## Oveview
Reactive Motion Planning for AVs requires very complex algorithms and high computational power to safely complete a journey. Active research is going on for a complete vision-based autonomous driving system which increases the computational load on the vision system. Hence it becomes extremely important to make different modules, like road-sign classification, less computationally expensive while maintaining high accuracy. A lot of research is going on to obtain a highly accurate light-weight Neural-Network for such multi-class classification problems. The GTSRB dataset is widely used for the evaluation in research. This project assesses the performance of the AlexNet and GoogLeNet models with required modifications on the [GTSRB](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html) dataset.
