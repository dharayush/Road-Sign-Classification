# Road-Sign-Classification

Reactive Motion Planning for AVs requires very complex algorithms and high computational power to safely complete a journey. It has become extremely important to make different modules, like road-sign classification, less computationally expensive while maintaining high accuracy. A lot of research is going on to obtain a highly accurate light-weight Neural-Network for such multi-class classification problems. This project assesses the performance of the [AlexNet](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf) and [GoogLeNet](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1409.4842) architectures with required modifications on the [GTSRB](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html) dataset. In this project we trained and validated the model. The final results can be found in our submitted paper
